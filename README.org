This package implements a modern looks for your Org buffers using font locking
and display properties. The package styles headlines, keywords, tables and
source blocks. The styling is configurable, you can enable, disable or modify
the style of each syntax element individually. Take a look at the =org-modern=
customization group.

The tag style of =org-modern= is a poor Emacsien's ripoff from the style of
Nicholas Rougier's beautiful [[https://github.com/rougier/svg-tag-mode][svg-tag-mode]]. In contrast to =svg-tag-mode=, this
package avoids images and uses cheap and fast Emacs box display properties.
Unfortunately this significantly restricts the flexibility in styling and may
lead to font-dependent issues. We do our best, but for example we cannot get
round corners. Of course a combination of =org-modern= with =svg-tag-mode= is
possible. You can use SVG tags and use the table and block styling from
=org-modern=. If you are interested in further tweaks, there exists also the
=prettify-symbols-mode= which can be used for individual styling of custom
keywords.

Another very popular alternative is [[https://github.com/integral-dw/org-superstar-mode][org-superstar]], which has a more restricted
feature set and mainly styles headlines and lists. In contrast to =org-modern=,
which uses display properties, =org-superstar= relies on character composition,
which is considered less future-proof.

This is how the [[file:example.org][example.org]] looks with =org-modern= and the [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes][modus-themes]]:

Enable manually by invoking =org-modern-mode= or add the mode to your Org mode
hook list.
